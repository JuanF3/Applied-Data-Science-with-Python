# VLE-Dataset an Analizing and Prediction task
In this notebook, two machine learning models have been implemented: Linear regression and Gradien Bost Regressor to predict the average engagement of the videos on the VideoLectures.Net platform.

One critical property of a video is engagement: how interesting or "engaging" it is for viewers, so that they decide to keep watching. Engagement is critical for learning, whether the instruction is coming from a video or any other source. There are many ways to define engagement with video, but one common approach is to estimate it by measuring how much of the video a user watches. If the video is not interesting and does not engage a viewer, they will typically abandon it quickly, e.g. only watch 5 or 10% of the total.
